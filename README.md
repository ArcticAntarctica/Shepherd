# Shepherd - PC game prototype envisioning traffic rush genre in another setting

## Intro 

Reimagine the classic Rush Hour sliding-block challenge through the tranquil chaos of farm life. In this strategic puzzle prototype, you play as a shepherd guiding flocks through crowded pastures, maneuvering animals and obstacles to clear paths in order to escape the animal pastures.

## Core Concept:

Farmyard Rush Hour – Slide sheep, cows, and other farm animals in grid-based puzzles

Growing Complexity – Start with simple pastures, advance to densely packed barnyard mazes

Idyllic Meets Intellectual – Serene rural aesthetic meets brain-teasing mechanics
